==============
todo_parser.py
==============

A module for converting files in the `todo.txt format <http://todotxt.com/>`_ to Python objects that allow
in-memory editing operations on the representation; these objects can regenerate the contents of the file,
allowing for round-trip editing.

Dependencies
============

None apart from Python; tested on 2.7.1.

Usage
=====

Command Line
------------

When run from the command line this module should simply parse any files given (or stdin) and print them
out after round-tripping them. This is present purely for easy verification of the parse correctness.

Code
----

Simply instantiate a TodoFile object from your file data::

    tf = TodoFile(filedata)

Then modify it as desired::

    tf.complete_item(5)

When finished, the new representation can be retrieved by string conversion::

    dest.write(str(tf))

To work with two files (e.g. for archiving)::

    src_file = TodoFile(src_data)
    dest_file = TodoFile(dest_data)

    src_file.move_item(3, dest_file)
    src_file.archive_all_items(dest_file)

    src.write(str(src_file))
    dest.write(str(dest_file))
